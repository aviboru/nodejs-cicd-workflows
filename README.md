## ðŸš€ How to Use

In your application repo (e.g. `node-app`), reference the reusable workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  compile:
    uses: your-org/nodejs-cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/build-compile.yml@main

  test:
    needs: compile
    uses: your-org/nodejs-cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/build-test.yml@main

  quality:
    needs: test
    uses: your-org/nodejs-cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/build-quality.yml@main

  security:
    needs: quality
    uses: your-org/nodejs-cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/build-security.yml@main

  package:
    needs: security
    uses: your-org/nodejs-cicd-workflows/.github/workflows/build-package.yml@main
    with:
      REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
      COMMIT_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
    secrets:
      DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
      DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
```

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- GitHub Actions enabled on consuming repo
- Secrets:
